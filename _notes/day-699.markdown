1. **The Justice Department asked an unnamed foreign company to comply with a grand jury subpoena from Robert Mueller and turn over information about its commercial activities as part of a secret court case.** Very little is known about the details of the case, but the company fighting the subpoena has been identified as a foreign government-owned company tied to Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Court officials have taken drastic steps to ensure the identity of the company remains unknown.

2. **The Senate overwhelmingly passed the most substantial criminal justice reform bill in decades.** The bipartisan First Step Act would expand job training and other anti-recidivism programs, modify sentencing and mandatory minimum laws, and expand early-release programs. House leaders vowed to pass the measure this week and Trump has said he plans to sign it into law.

3. **Trump signed a letter of intent to move forward with plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, despite Giuliani's insistence that he did no such thing.** "It was a real estate project. There was a letter of intent to go forward, but no one signed it," Giuliani told CNN. But CNN obtained a copy of the letter, which bears Trump's signature and is dated Oct. 28, 2015.

4. **A panel of judges dismissed dozens of ethics complaints filed against Brett Kavanaugh because they were filed under a federal law that does not apply to Supreme Court justices.** Federal judges concluded that the complaints were "serious" but must be dismissed without consideration of their merits because of Kavanaugh's confirmation in October to the Supreme Court. The decision was not unexpected, since the 1980 Judicial Conduct and Disability Act only outlines procedures for filing complaints against federal judges but doesn't cover Supreme Court justices.
